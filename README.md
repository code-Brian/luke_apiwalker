# Luke APIwalker 
## Todo:
- [ ] Create a dropdown menu that allows the user to choose the resource they are looking for
- [ ] Next to the dropdown menu, create an input field that accepts a number that will be used to query a specific id
- [ ] Add a button to all them to send a request to the API
- [ ] On submission, navigate to the appropriate route and render at least 4 attributes for that specific resource
- [ ] If the request is unsuccessful, create an error message that says "These aren't the droids you're looking for", with a picture of Obi Wan Kenobi
-[ ] NINJA Bonus: If the resource is "people", extract the ID from the homeworld URL provided, and render a link to that specific planet. It's okay if the link text is simply "homeworld"
- [ ] NINJA Bonus: If the resource is "people", output the name of the character's homeworld(you may need to make another request)
- [ ] NINJA Bonus: Add additional resources aside from people and planets to the dropdown menu
